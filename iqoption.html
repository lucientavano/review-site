                I could scan my ID and bank statement (as proof of adress) with my phone. It sounds unsurprising, but believe me it is not the case with all trading apps. The ID was validated immediatly, so I assume it is an automatic process. The address proof got screened within a few hours (by a human then I guess) but got rejected. The reason: it was indeed a letter from my bank with my address on it, but it was not a bank statement, just a regular communication, so the KYC (Know Your Customer) department of IQoption couldn't accept it. After submiting a propper bank statement, it got validated without any problem. Interesting to note that not having my address proof validated didn't delay the moment I could start trading real money, nor did it seem to delay my withdrawals. I have however read here and there that some people couldn't withdraw until they had fully verified their account, so keep that in mind if you're experiencing some difficulties.

                Just $10 required deposit to start, and it got instantly credited to my account. Instant funding is not uncommon, so it's not necessarily a big differentiator, but it is certainly a must-have to please Gen Y and Gen Z users. More and more brokers are starting to enable it. What is quite effective in terms of triggering the decision to switch from demo to real trading is the super tiny minimum for their required deposit. No scam here, it's really only $10, so if you're unsatisfied with the app or the broker itself, you will not have paid too much to fully discover the platform. The app used to offer bonuses upon funding your account by giving you extra credit, but it is not the case anymore due to a change of regulation.

                Both the withdrawal attemps I made were approved and processed instantly (despite the fact that my account wasn't fully verified yet because I still had to submit a proof of address!). I had, however, to use an e-wallet (I use <a href="https://skrill.com" target="_blank">Skrill</a>, since PayPal is rarely accepted by brokers) to get my profits (what was in excess of the initial deposit that I had done with my regular credit card). Indeed, the maximum amount I could withdraw back to my credit card was limited to the initial amount I deposited. This is for IQ Option a way to avoid the high bank card's fee. I'm fine with that, I think it's fair since IQ Option didn't pass on to me any of the deposit or withdrawal fees that must have been charged by the payment gateway. I can give it the <span class="badge badge-success">verified</span> badge.

                The app is literally packed with features. Almost too many in my opinion. It is easy/intuitive to navigate if you know what you're looking for (like a specific indicator) but it will be a tad overwhelming on a small device's screen for finance beginners who are trying to "explore" the app. For those who are highly technical, all the main indicators are provided, and you can play with many parameters, just like if you were on the full desktop version. The smoothness of the charts makes whatching the data stream very pleasant. It is quite rare to have this feeling with a trading app, and it is due to the technology chosen by Iqoption (OpenGL) to develop its platform, which is a rather unique choice. This app offers both binary options and what they call "classic" options (regular options as offered by institutional banks). Note that the design of binary options is such that it tends to make users trade very actively (you can select an expirery as low as 1 minute).

                A few minutes after signing up, someone called me (which I usually don't like). But to my surprise it was not a sales speech or a sweet talk to make me deposit (more) money. The focus was exclusively on explaining me the app's technical features despite no attempt from my side to discourage any sales speech. Nice! But I don't think calling prospective users is necessary. Let us live our lives! I also exchanged a few emails with IQoption KYC department in regards with a second account that I tried to create for writing this review, and I have to said they replied very fast and on point, so overall, pretty satisfied with IQoption back office, even though I'm not a big fan of sales phone calls, even if they are friendly.
